# Rate of Change of Contributors

Question: How is the number of contributors changing over time?

## Description
This metric is an indication of the amount of active contributors that are working on a given project over a time period. This can give a better indication of the growth of the project team, as well as a warning indication if the rate of change of contributors is negative (people are leaving the project.) 

## Objectives
By looking at the rate that the number of contributors is changing, one can easily determine whether the project is rapidly expanding or declining. The number of contributors at any given time may not be enough information, as a team of 6 may be alright for some projects, but it could be a negative indicator if a month ago that same project had a team of 30. By analyzing the rate of change of contributors, users can more easily quantitatively see the growth or decline of a project. 

## Implementation
This can take advantage of already implemented metrics. By using the Contributors metric and measuring its result at many different periods of time, we can get the overall rate of change of contributors of the project.
