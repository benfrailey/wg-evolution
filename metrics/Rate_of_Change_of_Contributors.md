New Contributors
Question: How many contributors are making their first contribution to a given project and who are they?

Description
This metric is an indication of how many new contributors there are to a given project in a specified time period. Like most impressions, the first contribution can be of critical importance for making the contributor feel welcome to the community. Additionally, the number of new contributions can in some cases be viewed as a reflection of the projects popularity or ability to market itself, as projects that are in the limelight could be more likely to have more contributions just because more people know about it.

This is a specific implementation of the Contributors metric.

Objectives
An increase or decline in new contributors can be an early indicator of project health. Understanding the behavior and barriers of new community members requires knowing who they are. Welcome new contributors and thank them for their first contribution.

Implementation
For each Contributor, only consider their first contribution.
